Tissue types were not batched by plate. Bisulfite conversion was applied to 500 ng of DNA using EZ-96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA).",Cy5 and Cy3,Standard Illumina Protocol,9606,"All samples were  prepared and analyzed in accordance with the manufacturer guidelines and protocol for the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). That is, bisulphite converted DNA was amplified, fragmented and hybridised to IIllumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip using standard Illumina protocol",Arrays were imaged using BeadArray Reader using standard recommended Illumina scanner setting,sample name:,"Raw DNAm data was processed with ChAMP software. For sample quality control (QC), we excluded (1) 3 samples with undetectable or missing methylation values (detection P > 0.01) in ≥ 5% of CpGs and (2) 6 samples with mismatched sex. For CpG QC, we excluded (1) CpGs that had detection P > 0.01 in ≥ 1 samples (N = 44,135) and that had a beadcount < 3 in ≥ 5% samples (N = 660), (2) cross-reactive CpGs (N = 40,812), (3) variant-overlapping CpGs or within a single base pair extension (N = 7,708) and (4) CpGs mapping to sex chromosomes. For filters (2) and (3), we selected CpG probes overlapping variants defined at MAF > 5% in 1000G. A total of 754,054 CpGs passed QC, could be mapped and lifted over from GRCh37 to GRCh38 human genome build and were retained for further analysis. Raw DNAm values were background-adjusted using the single sample normal-exponential out-of-band (ssnoob) method with dye bias correction. DNAm β values were normalized using the beta mixture quantile (BMIQ) method, adjusting for type I/II probe bias; output β values for each CpG were used in downstream analysis. After normalization, we removed one additional sample with array-derived genotype profile not matching the WGS-derived one. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on DNAm β values within each tissue type, and 3 samples were removed for being outliers with respect to the top 5 principal components (PCs) of the corresponding tissue.
